This document specifies the required characteristics of each template. The keys used in the templateSettings.json will be used to refer to them. The name of the element should be used as the id or class in case of cells.
In addition to these templates, the templateSettings file also specifies some images to be used:
defaultBanner: used as a board default banner.
spoiler: used as spoiler image.
thumb: used as generic thumb.
audioThumb: used as generic thumb for audio files.
maintenanceImage: displayed when a dynamic image is requested while the engine is in maintenance mode.

Optional elements can be declared on the "optional" key. On this key, put an object. This object will have each key being the element on both cells and pages, identified by id on pages and classes on cells.

The value of every entry, both optionals and specified is the relative path of the file inside the templates directory.

To run the optional elements on static files, create an entry named "templated" and set it as an array with the relative paths to the files to the static directory.
